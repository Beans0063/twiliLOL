MailChimp LOLCode Interpreter
---------------------------------------
Version: 0.3


About
---------------------------------------
The MailChimp LOLCode interpreter allows you to write and run lolcode scripts. It mostly conforms to the lolcode 1.0 spec and picks up pieces of the more recent 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 specs/proprosals where we needed something they defined. After that, we just made things up. Also, when we didn't like something or found something more lulzy, we just did whatever we pleased. 

Some highlights of what the interpreter supports: 
BUKKIT - multi-dimensional arrays and associative arrays/hashses 
GIMMEH - io - file i/o, read from STDIN, network IO via http 
MOARAGINS - eval() lolcode 
POOPONIT! - analogous to PHP's var_dump() for variable inspection 

This code was developed using Tetraboy's parser and we have, in fact, left some of that code intact in this release. Tetraboy's original site and code is here:

Building the MC-LOL Interpreter
---------------------------------------
1) First you need a working copy of RoadSend:
    http://www.roadsend.com/

    Make sure you follow their build/install instructions, especially the parts
    about downloading Bigloo Scheme 3.0c and having other development libraries
    around. You definitely need:
        * sqlite 3.3.x
        * libpcre 6.3
        
2) Run "make"
3) look for the binary in: bin/lol



Building the MC-LOL binary packages
---------------------------------------
[Linux]
1) Build the binary above.
2) Run "make linuxpkg"
3) look in the pkg/ directory


LOL
---------------------------------------
LOL is our very own acronym for a standardized data format that can be consumed by a lolcode script. It stands for LOL Objekt Langwedge. You can think of it like JSON, but in a more lulzy fashion. 

Also, really, it's just the bukkit grammar, but how could we pass up a recursive acronym, yaknow? 


Examples
---------------------------------------
We've packaged up some example scripts in the ./examples/ directory. Here's what they do:
test.lol - This is from Tetraboy's original index.lol example. It opens a SQLite db and prints data from it 
test2.lol - This example shows creating an associative array and printing its values. 
test3.lol - This example shows reading in LOL format, eval'ing it, and then iterating over and printing the 'imported' variables. 
test4.lol - This example shows off using the IO package to download a LOL formatted data file over the intertubes, evals it, and works with the data in the local scope 
test5.lol - This example shows off using the IO package to prompt for input to save in a variable, then spits it back out. 
test6.lol - This is from Tetraboy's original index.lol example. It shows defining a function, variable assignments, and incrememting numbers


After building the binary, you can run them using something like:

    # make linux
    # bin/lol examples/test.lol
